# First thoughts and main goal

I want to be able to use speach to text and text to speach to interact with my local personal assistant.

This personal assistant will mainly be a knowledge repository.

For this it needs to have a local chatbot it can query as well as a vector database to store the knowledge. The raw knowledge will be text, photos, voice and video.

As it goes on I think it will be a good idea to include a TODO list and a calendar.

All in all this may transition into being a wholistic AI journal assistant

So I guess that the first thing that needs to be done is to set up the local stt and tts.

## TODO List

### First Steps: Core Functionality

1. **Speech-to-Text (STT) Integration**
   - Research and select a local/offline STT engine (e.g., Vosk, Whisper, DeepSpeech).
   - Implement a basic interface to capture voice input and convert it to text.
   - Test STT accuracy and performance on your hardware.

2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration**
   - Research and select a local/offline TTS engine (e.g., Coqui TTS, eSpeak, Piper).
   - Implement a basic interface to convert assistant responses to speech.
   - Test TTS voice quality and configuration.

3. **Local Chatbot Setup**
   - Choose a local LLM or rule-based chatbot framework (e.g., llama.cpp, GPT4All, Rasa).
   - Integrate the chatbot with the STT and TTS interfaces.
   - Enable basic conversational loop: voice input ‚Üí text ‚Üí chatbot ‚Üí voice output.

4. **Vector Database for Knowledge Storage**
   - Research local vector database options (e.g., ChromaDB, Qdrant, Milvus).
   - Set up the database and test storing/retrieving simple text entries.

### Next Steps: Expanding Capabilities

5. **Knowledge Ingestion**
   - Implement ingestion pipelines for text, photos, voice, and video.
   - Add metadata tagging and basic search functionality.

6. **Personal Knowledge Repository**
   - Design a schema for organizing and categorizing knowledge entries.
   - Add CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for knowledge items.

7. **TODO List and Calendar Integration**
   - Design and implement a simple TODO/task manager.
   - Integrate a local calendar (e.g., via ical or CalDAV).
   - Enable voice commands for adding/removing tasks and events.

8. **User Interface**
   - Consider a minimal GUI or web interface for manual input and review.
   - Optionally, add notifications or reminders.

9. **Privacy & Security**
   - Ensure all data is stored locally and securely.
   - Add user authentication if needed.

---

### Long-Term / Future Features

- Multi-modal knowledge linking (e.g., relate a photo to a text note).
- Advanced search and summarization across all knowledge types.
- Daily/weekly journal recap via voice.
- Integration with external APIs (weather, news, etc.) if desired.
- Mobile or remote access options.

### üîä **Whisper Server Access**

* You're running Whisper locally and want to access it remotely.
* You can expose Whisper via a **local web server** with an HTTP API and protect it with a **login or access key**.

---

### üåê **Remote Access**

* To access your local machine from the internet, you'd typically:

  * Use **port forwarding** (on your router)
  * Or use a tunneling service like **Tailscale**, **Ngrok**, or **Cloudflare Tunnel**
* This allows secure access without exposing your whole machine.

---

### üîê **Securing the Service**

* Instead of full login, you can:

  * Use a **secret API key** in headers or URL
  * Store the key in cookies or localStorage for web UIs
  * Optionally use SSH-style public/private key auth for advanced use cases
* You can use the key across your devices without login screens.

---

### üí° **Smart Display Setup**

* Your **Surface Pro 3** is being used like a smart mirror.

  * Constant screen-on usage is fine for LCDs, with very slow wear over years.
  * Dim the screen and use dark UI to prolong its life and save power (\~\$1.50/month).

---

### ‚ö° **Desktop Power Usage**

* With an RTX 3070:

  * Idle: \~\$0.25/day
  * Light use: \~\$0.40/day
  * Full load (e.g., Whisper using GPU): \~\$1.20/day
* Costs depend on how heavily Whisper runs and how often.

---

### üìì **Day One Journaling**

* No public API, but:

  * You can use **iOS Shortcuts** to programmatically create entries.
  * On macOS, there's a `dayone2` CLI tool.
  * You can create automations and sync journals across devices this way.
