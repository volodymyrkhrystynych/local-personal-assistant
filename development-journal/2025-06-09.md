# Frist thoughts and main goal

I want to be able to use speach to text and text to speach to interact with my local personal assistant.

This personal assistant will mainly be a knowledge repository.

For this it needs to have a local chatbot it can query as well as a vector database to store the knowledge. The raw knowledge will be text, photos, voice and video.

As it goes on I think it will be a good idea to include a TODO list and a calendar.

All in all this may transition into being a wholistic AI journal assistant
